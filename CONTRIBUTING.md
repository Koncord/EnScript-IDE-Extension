# Contributing to EnScript IDE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EnScript IDE! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- VS Code (for testing the extension)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koncord/enscript-ide-extension.git
   cd enscript-ide-extension
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Start watch mode (for development):**
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Extension

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
3. The extension will be loaded in a new VS Code window
4. Open a `.c` file to test EnScript features

### Code Style

- We use ESLint for code linting
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
- Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix issues

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Run tests with `npm test`
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-something` - for new features
- `fix/resolve-issue` - for bug fixes
